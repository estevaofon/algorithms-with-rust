# Algorithms-with-rust

An open source project with educational implementations of **data structures** and **algorithms** in Rust.

## Motivation

The objective of this project is to serve as study material and a reference for developers who want to learn more about how these data structures work internally in Rust. The implementations are simple and straightforward, making it easier to understand the concepts and serving as a foundation for future extensions.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows Cargo's convention for multiple binaries:

```bash
data-structures-and-algorithms-with-rust/
├── Cargo.toml
└── src/
    └── bin/
        ├── linked_lists.rs
        └── dynamic_array.rs

Each file in src/bin/ is compiled as a separate executable.
## How to Run

To run the Linked Lists implementation, use the command:

```bash
cargo run --bin linked_lists
cargo run --bin dynamic_array
```
## Contributions

Contributions are very welcome! If you wish to improve the implementations, fix bugs, or suggest new data structures and algorithms, feel free to contribute.
